# MyStudy

This repository is for notes from my technology studies. It is not a step-by-step tutorial but contains brief notes and explanations. The primary focus is to serve as my memory aid. Even tutorials for concepts I am recreating to better memorize, despite being at a beginner level, will not include detailed explanations.

In the subfolders of this repository, there is material in Brazilian Portuguese, such as Accounting and Management. The other subfolders will be in English (even if with errors, I welcome suggestions).
